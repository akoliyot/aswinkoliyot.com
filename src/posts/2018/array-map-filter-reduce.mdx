```map()```, ```reduce()```, and ```filter()``` are 3 of the many built-in array methods in JavaScript. They allow us to perform calculations or conditional operations on each array element and returns the result.

## Map
```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let result = arr.map(el => el * 2); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

The map method returns an array after performing some operation on each item on the array. 

## Reduce
```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let result = arr.reduce((acc, el) => {
  return acc + el;
})
// result = 10;
```
Use the reduce function when you want to reduce (aggregate) the elements inside an array into a single value.

## Filter
```javascript
let words = ['anomalistic', 'cuddlesome', 'proficuous', 'cat', 'dog'];
let longWords = words.filter(word => word.length > 7);
```
The filter method can be used to filter out elements in an array based on any condition you provide.
