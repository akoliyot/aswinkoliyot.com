In order for your computer to be able to identify which ssh key to use for which account, you need to specify an ssh configuration. On a Mac you can do this by creating a file called "config" inside "/Users/Aswin/.ssh"

Suppose you have 2 Gitlab accounts like below and you want to access your personal repo from your personal account and your work repo from your work account: 
```

Personal: 
johndoe
johndoe@gmail.com
your_password
https://gitlab.com/johndoe/my-personal-repo

Work:
johndoe2
johndoe@work-place.com
your_password_2
https://gitlab.com/johndoe2/my-work-repo
```

You can set up your config like below but before it can work you'll also need to setup your ssh keys – there are lots of tutorials on how to do this for each OS, so please search.

The host can be anything you like, but keep in mind that you’ll need to update the url you use when cloning and such.
```
// johndoe on Gitlab
Host me.gitlab.com
    Hostname gitlab.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitlab

// johndoe2 on Gitlab (Codinent)
Host work.gitlab.com
    Hostname gitlab.com
    User git
    PubKeyAuthentication yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitlab-work
```

Now for any new repos that you want to clone you can modify the URL to use your custom host – this will specify which ssh key to use.

```
// For a url: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce

// When you want to use your personal ssh key: 
https://me.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce

// When you want to use your work ssh key: 
https://work.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce
```
