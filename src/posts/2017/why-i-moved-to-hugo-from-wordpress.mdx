I recently started blogging on WordPress and at first it seemed like the perfect choice. I could get started quickly and focus on creating content instead of spending a lot of time building the site. Plugins were also plenty for any extra functionality I wanted to add.

## But...

As I started writing posts and making modifications to get the theme running just the way I wanted it to, the entire process felt a little sluggish. I wanted something even simpler and faster.

Moreover, I would need to constantly make sure my WordPress installation and all of its plugins are up to date to make it secure.

When I needed to add an image slider to one of my posts, I tried 3 different plugins before I settled on Soliloquy slider. It had a clean UI and was quite easy to set up. Which brings me to the state of the plugins for WordPress. It seems like there's a lot of spammy content out there, especially for the basic things a lot of people would need for their website. I didn't want to have to go through anything like that again.

WordPress is excellent for providing a good UI for managing the website itself. You could add logos, images, edit the header and footer without diving into the code at all. In my case though, I found myself doing a lot of these changes by editing the code because I wanted to tweak some settings that weren't available to me through the UI.

A few weeks of this and I figured something needed to change.

## Exploring other options

I came across an article by [Sara Soueidan](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/jekyll-ghpages-to-hugo-netlify/) where she talks about how she was using Hugo for her new website. Intrigued, I took a look. Skimming through the docs I thought Hugo was simple enough to get started with.

I quickly learned how to set up a sample project and figured out the bare essentials. Hugo also provided lots of themes and a great documentation.

At this time, I was also playing around with Grav - a flat file CMS - to see if it would be a good fit for my blog. Being lightweight, quick and with an admin panel plugin that provided similar functionality to the WordPress admin panel, it seemed like the perfect replacement.

For me Hugo and Grav presented a similar learning curve, and after a little more playing around I went back to Hugo.
Sara's article about her migration to Hugo was very helpful for me in understanding some concepts of Hugo, and it's probably why I went with it.

In my opinion, if you're considering making a blog you can't go wrong with either of them.

## Some other facts

- This is the third itration of my blog. Built the first one using core PHP and MySQL because I wanted to get into back-end development. Then I moved to WordPress because I wanted to take the blog in a different direction, and now I finally settled on Hugo.
- The theme I'm using is: https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-cactus-plus. Big thanks to [nodejh](https://github.com/nodejh) for making it.
